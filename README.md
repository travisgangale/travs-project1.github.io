Jeopardy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For project 1 i created a game of Jeopardy...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is your typical game of Jeopardy (With different colors of course). 
First you will look at the category and see which you would prefer to answer first.
Now you pick a dollar amount you would like to play for ($10, $20, etc...).
Now a answer is going to pop up in a seperate box and you will have to answer the
answer with a question. You have 4 choices to choose from and only 1 is correct.
If correct an alert will pop up telling you correct, if wrong an alert will pop up telling you incorrect.
